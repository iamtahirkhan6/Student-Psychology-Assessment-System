        Psychological assessment is a process of testing that uses a combination of techniques to help arrive at some hypotheses about a person and their behaviour, personality and capabilities. Psychological assessment is also referred to as psychological testing, or performing a psychological battery on a person.
Testing involves the use of formal tests such as questionnaires or checklists. These are often described as “norm-referenced” tests. That simply means the tests have been standardized so that test-takers are evaluated in a similar way, no matter where they live or who administers the test.
A norm-referenced test of a child's reading abilities, for example, may rank that child's ability compared to other children of similar age or grade level. Norm-referenced tests have been developed and evaluated by researchers and proven to be effective for measuring a particular trait or disorder.

        To solve the disadvantages of using the common method of physical sheets, we are going to implement a platform using the latest web technologies to develop a single page application which has multiples features such as:
        1)	Perform psychology test
        2)	Register an account
        3)	User dashboard for assessment.
